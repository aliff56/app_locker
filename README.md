# 📱 App Locker

A fully functional, customizable app locker built with **Flutter** for the frontend and **native Kotlin** for background app monitoring and locking.

This is my first big personal project aimed to be **practical and usable in daily life**, combining modern UI with real security features.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Lock any installed app** on your device with a PIN or pattern.  
🎨 **Customizable lock screen themes** – choose the look you like.  
🤳 **Intruder selfie** – secretly take a picture if someone enters the wrong password too many times (number of tries is configurable).  
🕵️‍♂️ **Camouflage mode** – disguise the app as something else, like a compass or browser.  
🛡 **Self-protection** – prevent the app from being uninstalled when enabled.  
🔒 The app **auto-locks itself upon closing**, so no one else can access it.

Built using:
- Flutter (for UI, settings, theming)
- Native Kotlin service (for monitoring background apps and locking mechanism)
